#Writing functions in python
#Using the indent methond
#e.g function_name:
#       code line 1
# def followed by the functions name is used to declare the function
# Similar to Java functions can also pass through functions
# Additionally the return keyword can be used to return a value to be used elsewhere
# Calling a function involves writing the functions name followed by () or placing required arguements within it
