# Module is specific piece of software that has specific functionality. Modules responsible for different things
# Writing modules are files with a .py extenstion. Name of the module will be the name of the file
#Calling functions from different modules first need importing using the import key word
# to import more specific things "from x import y function" would be used
#Importing all objects from a module you would use import *
#Can use conditions with importing.
# local variables inside module only loaded once

#Packages are namespaces that contain modules and packages. Directories with a twist
