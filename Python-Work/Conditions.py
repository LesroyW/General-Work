#Similar to Java with == and greater and less than
# Basic prints on if statements followed by : before excuting the instructions for it
# the in statement can be used to check if an object exists within a interable object
# Example - if name in ["John", "Rick"]:
# the is operator matches the values of the object instances themselve rather than the value
# no operator inverts the boolean expression
