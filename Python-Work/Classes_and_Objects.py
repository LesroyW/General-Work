# Defining a class is done through class Myclass:
#                                      variable = x
#                                      def function(self):
#                                      print(variable)
#Classes used as a template to create your objects
# Create another object and assign the class to it will have its functions and variables
#Access it using class.variable print(class.variable) will print x
# To access a function within the class do class.function()
