#Looping over a set of numbers
# For number in numbers:
#   print(number)  examples of for loop
# For loops can also loop of a range
#e.g for x in range(5):
#    print(x)
#While loops can also be used within it
#Break and continue statements can be used to skip the current block or return to the for/whil statement
# else clause can be used at the end after a while/for loop but won't be executed if a break function is reached in the loop but will if continue is used.
